## A. Theatre Square
### Introduction
This problem can be found at the official Codeforces website: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/A.

### Solution
This problem is quite simple. The approach used to solve the problem is by dividing the **vertical and horizontal side** of the Theatre Square with **a**, the side of the square flagstone to get the number of flagstones to be placed vertically and horizontally. After that, multiply both results from the vertical and horizontal side to obtain the total number of flagstones needed to fill the whole Theatre Square area.
```python
from math import ceil

n, m, a = [int(x) for x in input().split(" ")]

print(ceil(n / a) * ceil(m / a))
```
