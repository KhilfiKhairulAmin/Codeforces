## A. Theatre Square
### Introduction
This problem can be found at the official Codeforces website: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/A.

### Solution
This is a simple problem. The approach used to solve the problem is:
1. Divide the **horizontal** and **vertical** side of the Theatre Square with **a** to get the number of flagstones needed to be placed horizontally and vertically.
- Note: If the division yields value with decimal place, round it up to the next closest integer (the tiles can't be broken into smaller size!)
2. Multiply both results to get the number of flagstones needed to cover the whole area of the Theatre Square.

```python
from math import ceil

# Input
n, m, a = [int(x) for x in input().split(" ")]

# Process
vert = ceil(n / a)
hori = ceil(m / a)
total = vert * hori

# Output
print(total)

```
